# Academic Calculator (Desktop App)
Desktop version of my calculator app (https://jeffreyhui.com/grades) to download and use without accessing the site. Built with Electron. 

## How to Use

### Windows Installer
Clone the repo and run the installer inside '''/dist/installer''' folder

### npm and Electron
If you have npm and electron installed, you can simply clone the repo, then run '''npm install''' followed by '''npm start''' insde the repo. 

## Disclaimer
Building this was a learning tool for electron and Angular so it's probably still rough around the edges. If you find any bugs, please raise an issue.
